My name is Ori Donner, currently working at SQream Technologies as DataOps Engineer.

I have 10+ years of experience in data, from designing BI solutions, building Data Warehouses through managing Databases.

All those years I have had a strong feeling of doing data wrong. ETL processes were to cumborsome and slow, schema management was a nightmare I was in a constant search for simple solutions.
